* Decide on what the standard encoding should be (depends on suppliers of data)
* Make the descriptions presented in the GUI more modular, not hard coded.
* Get some things into a sqlite db, like filters
* There is no real reason for the list of subscribers to be a List. It would
  make a lot more sense for it to be a Map from SubscriberID to Subscribers
* Make a clear distinction between what data is global and what data is
  dependent on each issue. Most stuff, such as filters etc are still global.
