* Decide on what the standard encoding should be (depends on suppliers of data)
  Perhaps we can guess on a per-file basis?
* Make the descriptions presented in the GUI more modular, not hard coded.
* Get a clear definition of what data is mandatory per subscriber. Is city needed?
  From the old code it seems the zipCode is the only important part
* How should we handle the VIP list? Perhaps a special table that is always
  inserted into DistributedTo? Currently VIP has a SubscriberID of < 10000.
* Who gets the paper delivered by Posten? It seems from the current code
  that it is only VIPs, which seems reasonable given the high cost and the
  otherwise high number of subscribers that would get it by Posten. Although
  the VTAB export for posten only does not check for VIPs.
* Should NoThanks trump VIP? I think so...
