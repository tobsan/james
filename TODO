* Decide on what the standard encoding should be (depends on suppliers of data)
* Should SortPostNR be used?
* Create some kind of state of each issue that is tracked.
	- Get source data for addresses
	- Send formatted address lists to VTD/TB
	- Get misslists back
	- Redo address lists and send to VTAB
	- Get misslists from VTD/TB
	- Register misslists and close issue
* For each text formatting of a Subscriber, we should use some kind of pattern.
	- Maybe just an interface :: Subscriber -> String
	- But careful when it comes to CSV and Excel, use right formatting!
	- This also goes for the formatting in writing in importFile
* Make the descriptions presented in the GUI more modular, not hard coded.
* Read up on how a "factory" is really supposed to work
* Create an enum for distributor types, to use instead of Strings.
