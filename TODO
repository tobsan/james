* Decide on what the standard encoding should be (depends on suppliers of data)
  Perhaps we can guess on a per-file basis?
* Make the descriptions presented in the GUI more modular, not hard coded.
* Get a clear definition of what data is mandatory per subscriber. Is city needed?
  From the old code it seems the zipCode is the only important part
* Wrap all ActionListeners in a common class handling SQLExceptions (James.java)
* Use geographic filtering for zipcodes. 40* <= zipcode <= 54* should be enough
  to distribute to (all of Västra Götalands län). Of course, VIPs should be
  exempt from this limit. An example implementation exists in MasterFile.java.
* A nicer separation of functions beloning to a specific issue (MasterFile.java)
  and those that are global to the program (DBConnection.java, perhaps?)
* Become more robust wrt erroneous source material to James. 
* Add an option to remove an issue entirely
* Add an option to add source material to an issue after the initial creation
