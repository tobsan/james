* Decide on what the standard encoding should be (depends on suppliers of data)
  Perhaps we can guess on a per-file basis?
* Make the descriptions presented in the GUI more modular, not hard coded.
* Get some things into a sqlite db, like filters and reference files
  Create a new branch of the project when it is time to do this.
* Make a clear distinction between what data is global and what data is
  dependent on each issue. Most stuff, such as filters etc are still global.
* Merge "create issue" and "create address base". It is completely unreasonable
  to create an empty issue object without creating an address base.
